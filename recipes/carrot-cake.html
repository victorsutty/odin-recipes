    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>3cups grated carrots (you can grate the carrots in a food processor fitted with a shredding blade)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the cake: Position the racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Butter and flour three 9-inch round, 2-inch deep cake pans, flour the insides and tap out the excess.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt and set aside. In another bowl, stir together the carrots, chopped nuts, coconut and raisins.</li>
        <li>Working in a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with a whisk, beat the sugar and oil together until smooth. Add the eggs one by one and continue to beat until the batter is even smoother. If you are working in a mixer, reduce the speed to low, if you're working by hand switch to a large rubber spatula, and gently stir in the flour mixture — mix only until the dry ingredients disappear. Just as gently, stir in the chunky ingredients.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter among the baking pans and slide the pans into the oven. Bake the cakes for 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the pans top to bottom and front to back at the midway point. The cakes are properly baked when a knife inserted into the centers of the cakes comes out clean; the cakes will just start to come away from the edges. Transfer the pans to cooling racks, cool for 5 minutes, then turn out onto racks to cool to room temperature. (At this point, the cakes can be wrapped airtight and kept at room temperature overnight or frozen for up to 2 months; thaw before frosting.)</li>
        <li>For the frosting: Working in a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar and continue to beat until the frosting is velvety smooth. Beat in the lemon juice or extract.</li>
        <li>Roll out lengthways and fold into three as you would to make puff pastry (one fold).</li>
        <li>Leave for an hour in a cool place in cling film.</li>
        <li>Repeat the operation, adding the caster sugar. Fold the pastry once. Leave to stand again for 30 mins in a cool place. Roll out the pastry to a 4mm thickness and cut into 8cm squares.</li>
        <li>Place the pastry into circular moulds that have been greased and dusted with sugar, folding the corners in to the centre and then place these on a greased, sugared non-stick tray.</li>
        <li>Leave to rise for approx. 1hr30 at 24-26°C, during which the pastry should increase by half its volume. Bake for 40 mins at 180°C.</li>
    </ol>
